<!-- TITLE:3. Packing -->

Once you have every file you want to override or add to the game in your Work Directory, you need to pack up your work directory to create a modpack that the game will read.
Before packing up your mod, you should add a **meta file** to your Work Directory that describes the name of the mod and its version.
# The meta file (META.YML)
The meta file is a text file that you can create with notepad, for example, and that should be placed at the root of your Work Directory.
It should contain the following informations:
* **Name** of your mod
* **Version** of your mod (a number)
* **Author** of the mod (your name or pseudonym)

Here is an example of content for the meta file:

```
---
Name: LouveSystems' Statue
Version: 1
Author: Louve
```
