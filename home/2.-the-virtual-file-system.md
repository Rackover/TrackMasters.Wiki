<!-- TITLE:2. The virtual file system -->

# Data
All the data loaded by TrackMasters can be divided in two categories:
* **Hard data**, usually compiled in scrambled or obfuscated archives and that cannot be modified or should not be tampered with
* **Soft data**, which is clear data stored in common formats, and that can be modified by mounting ModPacks in the** Virtual File System**.

| Hard data | | Soft data |
| -------- | | -------- |
| Game code (C#) | | AI Code (Lua) |
| Existing textures | | Sound registers (XML)  |
| Existing models | | Sound banks |
| Existing track elements | | Additional track elements |
| Existing vehicles | | Hosts configuration file (XML) |
|     | | Localization files (XML) |

The Soft data of TrackMasters can be more closely inspected by taking a look at the `SOFTDATA` folder, in the game's root directory. The game root's directory location depends on your installation, but you will usually find it in `C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LS_TrackMasters\`. 

The Soft data directory contains data that you can override with a mod to change the game's behaviour. However, you can also add files to your modpack that aren't present in the Soft data directory to add entirely new content to the game.

:::warning Do not alter the contents SOFTDATA folder
You can copy the soft data from TrackMasters to your Work Directory for further inspection and/or modification. It is on the other hand **strongly advised against** modifying the softdata from the base game directly.
Modifying the soft data from TrackMasters directly without using modpacks **will** lead to compatibility issues, gameplay issues, and is likely to corrupt your new tracks.
All game modification should be done via the use of Modpacks, and never by modifying the game files directly
