This tool converts tracks from Lego Stunt Rally (.trk format) to the TrackMasters format. It produces .PNG files with a sample image.

## Caveats
As LSR contains more and different track elements than TM, a lot of elements cannot be translated and are removed when converting from one format to the other.

The LSR starting line is also much tinier, as it accounts for less players (4) than TM (8). Therefore, the converted tracks are marked as `UNFINISHABLE` by the converter so that a manual edition in TM is required before playing on them.

On some tracks however, if standard 1x1 straight roads surround the starting line, the converter may remove one of them to make way for the TM Starting Line and lay it at the correct place. The track will however still be marked as `UNFINISHABLE` until it is opened in the TM editor and saved.
