<!-- TITLE:Create localizations -->

TrackMasters handle multiple languages and switching between them while ingame, seemlessly. 
You can add any number of language you like, by giving each of them their separate folder.**

# File structure
All languages are located at the virtual path `LOCALIZATION/`.
Each language is in its own subfolder at this path, and the name of each language's folder is the name it will appear as in the options menu.

:::info
It is recommended to use the name of each language in this language itself, and not the english name for that language.
For example: Name the french language "Fran√ßais" instead of "French", so you can make sure that french people will be able to select it whatever language the game is currently in (or if they cannot speak english).

Each language has its own subfolder that contains the files necessary for it to function
