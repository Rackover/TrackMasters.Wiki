<!-- TITLE:Create vehicles -->

TrackMasters supports the addition of new vehicles via modpaks. There is no limit to how many vehicles can be added to the game, but vehicles from the base game cannot be modified or removed themselves.

# What you'll need
In addition to the traditional [packing tool](https://wiki.trackmasters.louve.systems/read/home/3-packing.md) and [text editor](https://wiki.trackmasters.louve.systems/read/home/1-getting-started.md), you might need a 3D modelization software like Blender or Autodesk 3DSMax. If this is the first time you make a vehicle for TrackMasters, you might aswell want to check out the **vehicle editor**.
Although normally included with the game and present in the game's root directory, you can download it below if for any reason you are missing it.
